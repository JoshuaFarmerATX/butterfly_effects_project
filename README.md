# Butterfly Effect - University of Texas Data Visualization Bootcamp Project One

In this initial project, we ran analytics on data about internet usage by country and compared that to various demographics such as GDP, investment into education and population. 

## Getting Started

To run this application, all you need is python and the packages installed with the pipenv file. 

## Plots

There are several plots on various demographics within the repo. You can see them as their own PNG file, or within the Jupyter Lab file. Here is a sample of one of the PNG files, and the format they have all taken. Each of the scatter plots contain a trend line that helps illustrate the trends within the demographic measured.

We additionally measured top and bottom countries regarding internet use and population.

## Deployment

As this was our initial project, the deployment for this application is the Jupyter Lab file. Note: Because we used plotly for the chloropleth map, it is recommended to use Jupyter Lab rather than notebook because of compatibility issues with Jupyter Notebook. 

## Built With

* Jupyter Lab
* Pandas
* Plotly
* MatPlotLib
